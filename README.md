# eopf_toolkit

This repo collects R notebooks reading Copernicus Sentinel (satellite imagery) data. See

* [EOPF 101](https://github.com/eopf-toolkit/eopf-101) and the
* [ESA EOPF toolkit](https://github.com/eopf-toolkit) master project,

to which this activity tries to contribute working examples, and find limiting issues, from the R side.
