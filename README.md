# eopf_toolkit

This repo collects R notebooks reading Copernicus Sentinel (satellite imagery) data. See

* [EOPF 101](https://github.com/eopf-toolkit/eopf-101) and the
* [ESA EOPF toolkit](https://github.com/eopf-toolkit) master project,

to which this activity tries to contribute working examples, and find limiting issues, from the R side. 

Example notebooks:

* [Reading remote Zarr files using Rarr](remote_Zarr_via_Rarr.html)
* [Reading remote Zarr files using GDAL](remote_Zarr_via_GDAL.html)
* [Using rstac and gdalcubes](rstac+gdalcubes.html)
* [Fire Detection](fire_detection.html)
